I am a Research Scientist at the [Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering (ECpE)](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/), [Iowa
State University (ISU), USA](https://www.iastate.edu/) and affiliated
to [Center for Wireless, Communities, and Innovation
(WiCI)](https://wici.iastate.edu). My primary focus is on the project
[**<u>ARA: Wireless Living Lab for Smart and Connected Rural
Communities</u>**](https://arawireless.org/) [Part of the [**NSF
Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research
(PAWR)**](https://advancedwireless.org/) program] under the mentorship
of [**Prof. Hongwei
Zhang**](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/). Prior to joining ISU,
I completed my PhD from [Indian Institute of Space Science and
Technology (IIST), India](https://www.iist.ac.in/), in 2021 under the
guidance of
[Prof. B. S. Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj). I
pursued my masters and bachelors degrees from [National Institute of
Technology, Calicut (NITC)](http://nitc.ac.in/) and [Mahatma Gandhi
University (MGU)](http://www.mguniversity.edu/), India,
respectively. In the broad sense, I am interested in the design and
development of next generation wireless infrastructures.<br>
