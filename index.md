### About Me


<img class="shaded-image" src="images/sarath.jpeg" width="190" hspace="10pt" style="float:left">

I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering (ECpE)](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/), [Iowa
State University (ISU), USA](https://www.iastate.edu/) and affiliated
with the [Center for Wireless, Communities, and Innovation
(WiCI)](https://wici.iastate.edu). My primary focus is on the project
[**<u>ARA: Wireless Living Lab for Smart and Connected Rural
Communities</u>**](https://arawireless.org/) [Part of the [**NSF
Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research
(PAWR)**](https://advancedwireless.org/) program] under the mentorship
of
[**Prof.&nbsp;Hongwei&nbsp;Zhang**](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/). 

Prior to joining ISU, I completed my PhD at the [Indian Institute of
Space Science and Technology (IIST), India](https://www.iist.ac.in/),
in 2021 under the guidance of
[Prof.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Manoj](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj). I
obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees from the [National
Institute of Technology, Calicut (NITC)](http://nitc.ac.in/) and
[Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU)](http://www.mguniversity.edu/),
India, respectively. 

Broadly, my research interests lie in the design and development of
next generation wireless infrastructures.
