### Research Focus & Interests

* **Distributed Systems, Testbeds, and Network Measurement:** Design,
  development, and deployment of scalable, resilient, and secure
  distributed computing and communication systems across heterogeneous
  compute, storage, and wireless platforms, including building
  prototypes and testbeds, and performing real-world network
  measurements for evaluating and optimizing system performance,
  reliability, fault-tolerance, and security.

* **Next Generation Wireless Networks:** Experimental design,
  evaluation, and deployment of real-world wireless and distributed
  system testbeds for 5G and beyond, and Open Radio Access Networks
  (Open RAN), wireless mesh networks, and satellite networks.

* **Software Defined Wireless Networks and Internet of Things (IoT):**
  Modeling and implementation of Software Defined Networking
  (SDN)-based approaches in wireless systems (including wireless mesh
  networks, delay/disruption tolerant networks, and sensor networks)
  and building lightweight solutions (such as blockchain-based
  frameworks for IoT) to support emerging applications.

* **Complex Network Analysis for Applied Systems:** Applying complex
  network tools to analyze practical systems such as road networks and
  intelligent transportation systems, enabling the design and
  development of mobility models, routing protocols, and security
  frameworks.

* **Systems Security:** Analysis of security threats and attacks on
  Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, and the design and
  implementation of practical defense mechanisms to ensure reliability
  and resilience.
